There is a variety so the different colours give different levels of fondant or none at all. I like the golden colour ones best but others who ate them prefer the green. They don't last long though as they are so moorish and lovely with coffee.

Not a very high pork content for the price and very gristly (mightve been a bad pack but some other reviewers also noted this issue).  There was a spice/herb that was pretty over powering for our tastes, I like plain sausages so if these were advertised as a certain herb or spice I wouldnt have bought them.  Wouldnt buy again personally.

Review Heading: Nice but prefer cans rather than plastic bottles
Review Text: Received this a free gift to review. I normally buy Diet Coke and drink at least a couple of cans a day which is a bit naughty but hard to give up. I liked Coke Zero, nothing unpleasant about the drink but prefer Diet Coke probably more out of habit. If Ive run out the diet stuff and Ocado has none left in stock then I would consider buying Coke Zero. Taste wise it was light and refreshing but like all Coke products need to be cold out of the fridge to really enjoy.

Review Text: I was sent this as a free gift probably due to how much Coke we order. Ive tried this before many years ago so unsure if the recipe has changed as they seem to be pushing it a lot but I thought Id give it another try. 
As fine as it was to drink my personal preference is still Diet Coke. 
Would I buy this again? Yes but only if Diet Coke was unavailable. Its not terrible by any means, just missing one ingredient that I cant quite put my finger on.

Review Rating: 4
Review Heading: If limiting sugar intake these are for you
Review Text: So many people claim they can't lose weight and wonder why. All they have to do is read the nutrition labels on food packages and they'll find out that sugar is hidden in just about everything! Of course, if you're used to the baked beans that have sugar, these will seem tasteless to you at first. I suggest mixing half of these beans with half of the ones with added sugar, and gradually reducing the proportion of beans with added sugar. Personally we love these. I would prefer the sauce was a little thicker, but otherwise these beans are excellent.

It’s great that finally Heinz have bought out a no sugar, no artificial sweetener product to enjoy with breakfast although I did find them slightly lacking in flavour. Good proportion of sauce to beans. High in protein and low in calories. Easy to heat up , either using traditional saucepan or a few mins in the microwave. I would purchase these again as nice to have the option to have a sugar free healthy wholesome brekki to start the day

As a regular buyer of BOL products, this experience has (sadly) left me feeling less confident in re-purchasing their other items, too.

The crisps are enormous and have a gorgeous crisp, crunchy fresh texture and the most glorious flavours. They only use sunflower oil, not cheap harmful rapeseed oil which many brands have started to add, and they are British with locally sourced ingredients. The Atlas Mountains Wild Thyme & Rosemary are the best crisps I have ever eaten. Their whole range is outstanding!

Product Name: Rude Health Organic Ultimate Almond Longlife 1L
Review Rating: 4
Review Heading: Good but prefer Plenish
Review Text: I tried this as an alternative to my favourite Plenish which I have been buying for years. This is good, but nowhere near as tasty or flavoursome as Plenish Organic Almond Milk. They have identical ingredients in slightly different proportions - Plenish 5% organic almonds vs Rude Health 6% organic almonds (the other Rude Health Organic Almond Milk alternatives only contain a tiny percentage of organic almonds and are filled out with organic rice). Both brands are organic with no additives like oils, stabilisers, emulsifiers or flavourings, just two or three simple clean organic ingredients. I was surprised that, although Rude Health has 6% almonds and Plenish 5% almonds, Rude Health has a weak, watery, slightly bitter flavour and tastes less creamy than Plenish - with Plenish the clean, creamy depth of flavour is exceptional. However, both are perfect with cereals and porridge, lovely in tea and coffee, gorgeous as a drink on their own (cold and warm). Also brilliant in cooking. I would always choose Plenish over this, but Rude Health is a good back-up alternative.

But the last dozen tins I have bought (separately) have been completely different. The soup is no longer a beautifully clear and lovely broth, but a strange milky white colour with a very odd almost greasy taste. And it has made me feel ill every time I have tried this 'new' recipe. It is genuinely AWFUL now and I am very upset about it as it used to be gorgeous. Will not buy it again. Terrible :-(

If youre gluten free, go straight for these.

They have a gorgeous earthy, nutty flavour and perfect firm yet soft texture which they retain throughout cooking - the depth of flavour and texture is outstanding. I love that they are organic and do not contain any salt or citric acid or any other additives. Glorious in vegan curries, risotto, pasta and stir fry. They also make delicious vegan Shepherdess Pie flavoured with a little organic cinnamon. Also exquisite cooked with Garofalo Organic Bulgur Wheat and vegetables like risotto.  I also love the Epicure organic and Biona organic range of beans/pulses for the same reasons. Another winner from Mr Organic!

The only thing I don't like is the excessively thick (presumably to give a sense of being "premium") packaging, smart though it is.

Review Heading: this is the bomb in a chai latte
Review Text: I originally gave this a three stars and It's not Valencian Horchata (real tiger nut milk - that's delicious). I can only taste the rice. But it's not bad for rice milk to drink on it's own" and I said that it would probably taste powdery warmed up in a hot drink.  

HOWEVER, I have since warmed it up and had it in a Teapigs chai as a latte, oh my, this is THE BOMB especially on a cold and wet morning! It's especially good with half a teaspoon of Steerns manuka honey. AND it doesn't burn the bottom of the pan either like normal milk.  It's not valecian horchata, but now I've got over that, it's really good.

Review Rating: 3
Review Heading: Nice texture, good for all ages
Review Text: I bought these for myself, an adult, as a little treat. They are pureed treats that have been freeze dried and cut into square shapes. You get quite a fair bit in the package.  I've tried all three flavours available now and this is personally my least favourite,  I find the flavours in this one don't work as well and leave a strange aftertaste. 
But that might just be me.  You leave them on your tongue and  they will slowly dissolve. I prefer to nibble them slowly as the texture is so interesting. Lasts a while too, so not gone in an instant.  I imagine little one's would just adore these and it would keep them busy too.

They have a lovely crunch to them, and are noticeably less oily than normal crisps but they are somehow just not a satisfying crisp-eating experience. Strange.

Review Rating: 3
Review Heading: Bland
Review Text: I like this brand of crisps, and the crunch is good, not quite healthy, but healthier I guess.  But this flavour wasn’t just boring, but insipid.  Not enough salt perhaps?  Dried tomato is extremely strongly flavoured, and dried basil, while not resembling fresh basil, is quite an identifiable taste, and yet these crisps tasted as if someone left off most of the seasoning.  I suppose if you want bland crisps, but not just ready salted, they could be good.  Not for me though

This milk is fabulous though - super creamy, doesn't split when heated (at least not for me!), low calories (30kcal/100ml) and only 3 natural ingredients - no gums or sugars in here. Lovely, just lovely.

It doesn't even deserve one star.   Baxters should be ashamed of this very poor product.

Review Heading: Why have they changed the recipe?
Review Text: This used to be one of my little treats. Imo, this taste like cola from my childhood. I purchased some today, took a big swig and thought it tasted different, kind of bitter. Looked at the ingredients and see they have now replaced the sugar with stevia. I am not happy because it didn’t mention anything on the bottle about a change and I have gut issues and can not tolerate sweeteners. So thanks to Fentimans I now have a raging tummy ache and have to throw away my drink - urgh!

This is much better value and more convenient. As a coeliac who does a lot of Chinese cooking, I always have a bottle in my cupboard.  Tend to decant into a smaller bottle as easier to work with.

I found that the water went white when cooking the pasta, but that was the only real difference. It's just a shame that the gluten free options are so pricey. But this is probably worth it.

Review Heading: Quite sweet, pastry is nice.
Review Text: These haven't travelled well as most of the filling is in the packaging instead of the tart. Pastry is nice but lemon flavour is on the fake tasting side so very sweet with a more subtle lemony taste. Can imagine these would work well as a buildable base with added berries and cream. So would buy again with that in mind but not really something I would eat on its own.

Why does Ocado call this a Prawn curry? This is Plant-Based!  The brand calls it Goan Curry and basically, you mix it with what you fancy with suggestions for Jackfruit, Prawns or Fish.
An alternative to plastic would be better.

Review Text: Firstly, let’s just get it out of the way and state immediately that this is no where near a fine ale. Having said that however, it certainly doesn’t immediately strike you as non or low alcohol beverage either.

Nice and refreshing, and gives the same satisfaction that a regular can of beer does but without the gluten and alcohol related issues.

As a brilliant non or low alcoholic option; the only reason I can’t give this 5 stars is that the yuzu flavour is disappointingly weak (almost missing), otherwise it’s a nice and tasty compromise and I’m looking forward to trying the others in the range!

Review Text: This is the worst Korma sauce, in fact any sauce, I've ever tasted in my almost 64 years. It's hard to describe the taste as it was nothing like any Korma I've ever tasted. Not even the addition of cinnamon, ginger and sugar could save it. It was greasy, mostly tasteless but with a nasty aftertaste. I made it for my son and I and we both ate the rice and scraped the curry into the bin. I hate waste, but this stuff was inedible. I've had curry sauces that weren't very nice, but this was by far the worst. I never leave negative feedback normally, but had to on this occasion.

Review Text: I bought these to add to a seafood paella from the Moro cookbook.  I've been using the recipe for years but never bothered to source all of the authentic ingredients previously.  Sliced and used to decorate the finished dish, these looked and tasted great.  The jar is packed with peppers, all carefully trimmed, and in a neutral oil.  I just wish I'd thought to put the half empty jar in the fridge instead of the kitchen cupboard because when I came to use it again a few days later the top was growing white mould, which put me off.

Product Name: Heinz White Sauce for Lasagne  470g
Review Rating: 3
Review Heading: tasteless
Review Text: Tried this in my lasagne as I liked the idea of simple ingredients. But it was a bit lacking in flavour and creaminess for me so I added extra cheese to make up for it. I wont buy again but liked the idea.

Product Name: Heinz White Sauce for Lasagne  470g
Review Rating: 3
Review Heading: Interesting taste
Review Text: I was gifted this product in return for my honest review 
I’m no stranger to making a lasagne from scratch and love trying new flavours and ingredients. I think this sauce is a required taste. It’s not what I’m used to and, whilst not a crumb was left, I’m not sure I would go out of my way to purchase. If you are a fan of bay leaf flavouring and don’t mind bits in your sauce, go for it but it’s not for me
