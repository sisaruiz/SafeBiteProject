Review Heading: NO SUBSTITUTE FOR OLD ENGLISH CURE
Review Text: Ever since discovering Morrisons Old English Cure bacon earlier this year, it has been a firm favourite  and has been my weekend breakfast treat (served in an oven bottom muffin: delicious!).  Sadly it seems that Morrisons has discontinued that line, so I am left scrabbling around for an alternative  Looking for a dry cured, smoked bacon, I thought to give this a try  but I wish I hadnt: it was much too salty for my liking, and had very little depth of flavour.  It was also rather fatty, so I ended up having to tear the rashers apart, remove the eye, then trim the intramuscular fat from the part rashers remaining.  At least I had a decent amount of fat left to render down (to make what Americans call bacon grease)!

Despite other reviews, I did not find this bacon too thin at all: six rashers made up a 200g pack perfectly well.

This bacon did not measure up, for me, and my search for an Old English Cure replacement continues

Review Heading: Avoid. Tasteless Tissue Paper. 
Review Text: OK. I have just had my food delivered early, with thanks to the driver. I thought I would have a bacon sandwich. openned the packet. First issue is the bacon is not dry cured. The second is the bacon is cut so thin it is like tissue paper and is see through. Lastly, when cooked, the rashers are so pumped full of water to raise the weight, they boil to nothing and are tasteless.

Review Text: All these 1 star reviews seem to be from people who are used to very low pork sausages like Richmond.

This is what a real meaty sausage is like. You are just used to children's sausages. These are delicious and authentic and full of flavour.

I also didn't have any issues with the skin being thick, people must be cooking them wrong. They are better cooked in the oven or grill though, if you fry these all the fat is rendered out of them and the skin goes slimy.

I also think they were better before they were gluten free. That's true of all of Morrisons sausages, it's a shame they switched to pea flour.

Review Text: I normally buy the Morrisons gluten free crackers (60p a pack and really good), they were out of stock so I was sent these as a substitute.  They were over a pound more expensive than my regular Morrisons ones (Morrisons, when are you going to catch up with the other supermarkets and price match).  These ones are good, but there are less in the pack for the extra money.  Overall, I wouldn't buy these, or accept them as a substitute again as there are far fewer in the pack but are way more expensive than the ones I normally buy.  There was nothing wrong with the taste and texture - I'm just not willing to pay what they are charging for them.

Review Text: I've tried cookies and pancakes with this. Initially things tend to come out a little bit dry, so the pancakes didn't have that nice moist softness that the gluten brings, and the cookies were a bit crumbly. Then I tried adding a tablespoon of groundnut oil to the pancake mix and suddenly they were amazing again. Haven't tried this modification to other baking recipes but this flour is a great start.

If I could afford it, at this stage I would happily just sit there with a pack of butter and chomp the lot, theyre that good! But I cant! Because as with most decent free from things, they cost waaaay too much for waaaay to little.
Hands down though, the best gluten free rolls! Theyre even good when needing to make a sandwich the night before and refrigerating them. Obviously denser & softer the next day but still good! Love them! love them! love them! :))

Review Heading: The best gnocchi
Review Text: I'm not gluten free but have always preferred gluten free gnocchi, as I find the one made with wheat flour can have a bit of a gummy raw flour taste which is unpleasant and detracts from whatever you're pairing the gnocchi with. I have tried several brands of gluten-free gnocchi and this is the best of all, even beating my previous favourite that cost 3x as much for the same amount. I just wish this was sold in a 500g pack as well, as I always need to use two packs and it seems like a worst waste of plastic that way.

Review Text: I'd previously left a 5-star review like so many others, but with the new packaging comes a new product...oat dust! Probably to save a just few pennies, the quality of these oats have dipped hugely. Before, they were great quality visibly rolled oats. Now they look like instant porridge--just a fine dust. Useless for baking flapjacks and the like, plus for some reason if you make the oat dust into porridge it tastes weirdly metallic. Bleah! After years of buying this weekly, I'll be looking elsewhere.

Added my tomato paste, cheese, pre roasted veggies, salami & ham &  Cooked at 180c for around 13 minutes as wanted my toppings to cook well. Not a crumb left. Best part was no one  had heartburn or indigestion after as we normally do eating pizza.

Review Heading: Great for DIY pizza
Review Text: Great for easy DIY pizza if like me you have yet to find a decent homemade pizza recipe. The Morrisons own brand GF pizzas are nice enough for the price, but I'd rather pay a bit more and be able to make exactly the pizza I want. I would say the quality is comparable to the standard pizza counter base. You get 2 individually wrapped pizza bases in the box, so that makes it a bit more economical, and practical for storing. Was still good the next day as leftovers whereas most GF pizzas cannot last without loosing all sense of pizza texture. I'll be buying these from now on to make my own pizzas.

Review Text: I love the other biscuits in this range so I thought I'd give these a try. They are not good. They are more dry than the others, and although they do have berry pieces in, the "berry flavour" comes from a very artificial-tasting flavouring - quite unpleasant. I'll be sticking to the apple or ginger variants in future.

Review Rating: 4
Review Heading: Decent tasting gluten free bread
Review Text: A great alternative for anybody who has a gluten intolerance or does not eat gluten for health reasons. The bread is quite soft and works very well for sandwiches and as the name suggests, makes the better toast compared to the other genius breads. The taste and texture is noticeable grainy which is similar to a standard brown bread. Although it is good to have a gluten free version, I do feel these are quite expensive considering the size of the loaf is quite small compared to a standard loaf.

Review Heading: Soggy cone and no chocolate
Review Text: The cone was soft and chewy, not crisp like the main brand competitor.  The brown lining to the cone was a sort of powder, not a chocolate. The strawberry tasted just of frozen sugar.  The ice cream itself was ok, but there were too many disadvantages otherwise.  A pity because a free from cornet is a great idea.

Sadly lacking in options i was keen to try the new addition since the pecan pies dissappeared a year ago but i was hugely disappointed.
sickly sweet, lacking in apple flavour and more cardboard than crumble these were not worth the calories they added to my daily total - i can find nothing to recommend them as they had no redeeming features - Save your money!

Certainly worth a try if you want GF pizza at about a fifth of the price.

Review Text: Being a Coeliac I missed my porridge. I used to eat it everyday before I was diagnosed. After diagnosis I could only have porridge every now and again as couldn't tolerate it more than that. So, when a saw Quaker gluten free I got very excited. It was very yummy and I'll certainly buy again and again. I made it with cravendale semi skinned and whole earth stevia sugar. If I wanted to add anything I usually add walnuts, sliced banana or blueberries. Very nice.

Review Text: These used to be lovely. Thickly coated in chocolate, they felt like a real treat, despite the high price vs the market st dairy chocolate equivalent). Suddenly, the recipe seems to have changed. The chocolate coating is thinner, like it’s been watered down, and it’s more spare. They’re quite tasteless now. I had hoped it was just a bad batch but after a few months of no return to their former glory, I’ll no longer be buying them.

Review Text: I’m not sure why this product has received such bad reviews or if they have changed the recipe recently but the spaghetti is absolutely fine.  I used a very wide pan and two kettles of boiling water and then lit the gas to keep the boil of the water.  Added the spaghetti to water.  I didn’t add salt, or oil.  I continually stirred to make sure they didn’t stick together,  and then stirred every few mins. The water did go cloudy but it didn’t affect the taste.  I covered in a mascarpone sauce with garlic mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes.  It was beautiful

Review Heading: Great!
Review Text: For a gluten dairy soy nut free alternative, this is great! The chunks of cookie dough really mimic the real thing, comparable to Ben and jerrys! The Icecream itself is a little on the plain, given the limit ingredients but there’s plenty of chocolate and cookie dough to make up for it. You could dabble in adding your own dessert sauce to it, would defos do the trick. One major thing I’d add is, for us allergy sufferers finding something that doesn’t make us react is a given, and THIS didn’t make me feel sick or give me a tummy ache, even after eating the lot! My kids love it and so do I. I grabbed it in store for £1.50 (just saying, that’s an amazing price!)

Review Rating: 1
Review Heading: Bad
Review Text: Bland and watery.  Second bad experience I've had with a Sacla vegan product (their salad cream ended up in the bin).  This is bland and watery.  Doesn't taste of much except salty water.  Bought for convenience for a quick lasagne, but will go back to a knob of vegan butter, flour, oat milk, veg stock cube, spoon of mustard, pepper, nutmeg and shake of 'Bosh!' yeast flakes whisked together!

Review Heading: Disappointing 
Review Text: What's happened to this pastry! It used to be so good, but the last 4 I've had all had splits in when rolled out, so only half the pastry puffed up. There's a different texture to it, more wet and sticky.
